create a variable of type const called container equal to the container div (document.querySelector)

create a variable of type let called size. This variable will store the dimension of the etch a sketch grid. Assign an initial value of 32.

create a variable of type let called row. Do not assign an initial value. This variable will be used to create the row divs. 

create a variable of type let called pixel. Do not assign an initial value. This variable will be used to create the pixel divs.

create a variable of type let called pixels which is equal to all the pixel divs. Do not assign an initial value, assigned on grid creation.

create a variable of type const called slider. Assign an initial value of the slider element (document.querySelector('.slider'))


Create the default grid by calling createGrid and passing it the initial value for size


On input for the slider perform the following:
    ->set size equal to the slider value

    ->set the dimensions inner text to be the size

    ->call createGrid function to re-size the grid, passing it size as the argument



function: changeColour()
Function that changes the colour of a pixel when it is hovered over

check to see if rainbow mode is selected
    -> if rainbow mode is selected call a random function three times to generate rgb colour

    -> if it is not selected set the colour equal to the selected colour in the colour wheel

function: createGrid()
Function that creates the grid, taking a single input (the size)

    -> remove all the children nodes from the container element

    ->for loop starting at i = 1, while i is less than or equal to size, incrementing i by one

        ->set the value of row to equal a new div element 

        ->add the class 'row' to the row div element

        ->append the row div element to the container div

        ->for loop starting at j = 1, while j is less than or equal to size, incrementing j by one

            ->set the value of pixel to equal a new div element 

            ->add the class 'pixel' to the row div element

            ->append the pixel div element to the current row div


    -> set value of pixels to all the pixels

    -> Add eventlistener for each pixel of pixels. On hover, run the changeColour function
