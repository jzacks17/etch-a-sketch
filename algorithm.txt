create a variable of type const equal to the container div (document.querySelector)

create a variable of type const called size. This variable will store the dimension of the etch a sketch grid

create a variable of type let called row. Do not assign an initial value. This variable will be used to create the row divs. 

create a variable of type let called pixel. Do not assign an initial value. This variable will be used to create the pixel divs.

for loop starting at i = 1, while i is less than or equal to size, incrementing i by one

    set the value of row to equal a new div element 

    add the class 'row' to the row div element

    append the row div element to the container div

    for loop starting at j = 1, while j is less than or equal to size, incrementing j by one

        set the value of pixel to equal a new div element 

        add the class 'pixel' to the row div element

        append the pixel div element to the current row div

    end

end
