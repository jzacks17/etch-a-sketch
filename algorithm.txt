create a variable of type const called container equal to the container div (document.querySelector)

create a variable of type const called size. This variable will store the dimension of the etch a sketch grid

create a variable of type let called row. Do not assign an initial value. This variable will be used to create the row divs. 

create a variable of type let called pixel. Do not assign an initial value. This variable will be used to create the pixel divs.

for loop starting at i = 1, while i is less than or equal to size, incrementing i by one

    set the value of row to equal a new div element 

    add the class 'row' to the row div element

    append the row div element to the container div

    for loop starting at j = 1, while j is less than or equal to size, incrementing j by one

        set the value of pixel to equal a new div element 

        add the class 'pixel' to the row div element

        append the pixel div element to the current row div

    end

end

create a variable of type const called pixels which is equal to all the pixel divs (querySelectorAll)

add eventlistener for each pixel of pixels. On click, run the function changeColour. 

changeColour() function

when called change the colour of the pixel to the one that was clicked 

set the pixel's background colour to black
